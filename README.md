# QR Bon
This [Jugend Forscht](http://www.jugend-forscht.de/) (something like "Junior Science") project has 
the goal to replace receipts at supermarket checkouts by digital ones, to reduce paper consumption
and be more envoirement fiendly. This is only a prototype to demonstrate the idea so many features 
aren't available now. The project will be presentated at the Junior Science Competition.
For German speaking people, check out the [website](www.qr-bon.com).
Video of the competition (if taken) will be here soon.
